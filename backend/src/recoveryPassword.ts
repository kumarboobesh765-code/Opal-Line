/**
 * Superadmin recovery password.
 *
 * If the owner forgets their login password they can type the stable recovery
 * password into the normal Password box on the sign-in screen — it works as
 * the password itself, but only for owner-level accounts (Admin / Super Admin)
 * and only at the account the recovery password is presented for. It is
 * independent of the account password: changing the login password (including
 * through the recovery flow itself) never disables it, so it keeps working on
 * every future sign-in until it is rotated.
 *
 * The value is never stored in plaintext — only as an argon2id hash:
 *
 *   1. by default the built-in constant's hash
 *      (CONSTANTS.SUPERADMIN_RECOVERY_PASSWORD_HASH); the plaintext exists
 *      only in docs/recovery-password.md, and
 *   2. an optional rotated value, hashed with argon2id and kept in
 *      settings.notificationSettings.recoveryPasswordHash via
 *      Settings → Team → Recovery password.
 *
 * A rotated value written by ≤ v1.0.14 (AES-256-GCM encV1 under the app's
 * master key, recoveryPasswordEncrypted) is still honoured and is re-hashed
 * with argon2id on first use, after which the encrypted copy is dropped.
 *
 * Every use is recorded in the activity log, the login lockout still applies
 * to failed attempts, and non-owner roles are rejected before any comparison.
