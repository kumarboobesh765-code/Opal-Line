# Opal Line ERP — Configuration Guide

Every configuration surface in the project: **environment variables** (backend
`backend/.env`), **in-app settings** (stored in the database, edited via the
Settings UI), and **integration setup** (Shopify, email, WhatsApp, Razorpay,
backups). Each section shows a working example and the steps to apply it.

> Env vars are read once at server start — restart the backend after editing
> `backend/.env`. Values stored in the database (Shopify credentials, SMTP,
> WhatsApp) can be changed live from the UI and **override** env vars.

---

## 1. Core (required)

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/opal_line` | PostgreSQL connection (local install or Neon/Supabase cloud) |
| `PORT` | `47191` | Backend API port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (default: all interfaces) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | `production` disables pretty logs, verbose error bodies, dev transports |

**Example `backend/.env`:**

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:S3cret@localhost:5432/opal_line
PORT=47191
```

**Steps (dev machine):**

1. Install PostgreSQL 14+, create a database: `CREATE DATABASE opal_line;`
2. Copy `backend/.env.example` → `backend/.env`, fill `DATABASE_URL`.
3. `npm install` (repo root), then:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push      # create/update all tables
   npm run db:seed      # admin user, roles, settings row
   ```
4. `npm run dev` → UI at `http://127.0.0.1:47195`, API at `http://localhost:47191`.

Cloud database (Neon example) — just swap the URL and keep `sslmode=require`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@ep-cool-name.eu-central-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

## 2. Security

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | 64-char hex | AES-256-GCM key encrypting secrets stored in DB (Shopify token, SMTP, WhatsApp). **Leave empty on first run** — auto-generated to `.encryption-key`. Set the same value on every server sharing one database. |
| `CSRF_SECRET` | random hex | HMAC key for CSRF tokens. Auto-generated to `.csrf-secret` when empty. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | `Opal@2026` | Password for the seeded admin (seed run only). |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `1` / `loopback` / `"10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2"` | Trust Express `X-Forwarded-*` headers (needed behind nginx/Cloudflare for correct rate-limit keys and `req.ip`). **Never enable when directly exposed** — it lets clients spoof IPs. |

```env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
TRUST_PROXY=1
```

## 3. Shopify

Stored **in the database** (encrypted) via *System → Connections* — env vars are
only a fallback:

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SHOPIFY_STORE_URL` | `your-store` (or full `https://your-store.myshopify.com`) | Store identifier |
| `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `shpat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | Custom-app Admin API token |
| `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` | `2025-10` | Admin API version |
| `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | random hex | Verifies `/api/v1/webhooks/shopify` + Flow webhook HMAC |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `https://erp.example.com` | When set, order/product/customer webhooks are **auto-registered** at startup to point here |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:47195` | Allowed CORS origin (the desktop app default) |

**Steps:**

1. Shopify Admin → *Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps → Create an app*.
2. *Configure Admin API scopes*: `read/write products, orders, customers, inventory`.
3. *API credentials → Install app* → copy the **Admin API access token** (shown once).
4. ERP → *System → Connections → Shopify*: paste store URL + token → **Test** → **Save**.
5. Optional (auto webhooks): set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so the ERP registers
   `orders/create`, `orders/cancelled`, `orders/fulfilled`, `products/update`,
   `customers/create` on boot.
6. Dev stores redact customer PII on the API — set up the
   [Flow webhook](shopify-flow-webhook.md) and/or order-email ingestion (§5) to
   recover name/address.

## 4. Notifications email (SMTP / Resend)

Used for backup emails, payment reminders, dues statements, daily summary,
low-stock alerts. Env fallbacks; live values editable in *System → Settings →
Notifications* (stored encrypted):

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NOTIFICATION_SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` | SMTP server |
| `NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port (587 STARTTLS / 465 SSL) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | `Opal Line <no-reply@opalline.in>` | From header |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` | `owner@opalline.in` | Default recipient (backups, summaries) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_xxxxxxxxx` | Use Resend API instead of SMTP when set |

**Gmail example:**

```env
NOTIFICATION_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_FROM=Opal Line <no-reply@opalline.in>
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=owner@opalline.in
```

Steps for Gmail: enable 2FA → create an **App Password** → store it as the SMTP
password in *Settings → Notifications* (or `.env`). Verify with the **Send test
email** button on that page.

## 5. Order email ingestion (PII recovery)

Shopify's owner **"New Order" notification email is never redacted** — point a
dedicated mailbox at it and the ERP polls every 2 minutes, merging full customer
name/phone/address into imported orders:

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ORDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS` | `orders@yourdomain.com` | Mailbox that receives Shopify's new-order notification |
| `ORDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD` | `xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` | App password (Gmail) — values with the `encV1:` prefix are treated as already encrypted |
| `ORDER_EMAIL_HOST` | `imap.gmail.com` | IMAP server |
| `ORDER_EMAIL_PORT` | `993` | IMAP port |
| `ORDER_EMAIL_FOLDER` | `INBOX` | Folder to scan |
| `ORDER_EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `mailtm` | Use `mailtm` for a mail.tm REST mailbox, otherwise IMAP |

**Steps (Gmail):**

1. Create/choose a mailbox, e.g. `orders@yourdomain.com`.
2. Shopify Admin → *Settings → Notifications*: add that address as a **staff
   order notification** recipient.
3. Gmail: enable 2FA + IMAP (*Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP*), create an
   App Password.
4. `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   ORDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=orders@yourdomain.com
   ORDER_EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
   ORDER_EMAIL_HOST=imap.gmail.com
   ORDER_EMAIL_PORT=993
   ORDER_EMAIL_FOLDER=INBOX
   ```
5. Restart the backend. Check *Shopify → email ingest status* / the
   **Recover PII** button on the Customers page.

## 6. WhatsApp (Cloud API)

Sends invoice/order/shipping/payment-reminder messages:

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | `EAAG…` | Meta WhatsApp Cloud API token |
| `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | `123456789012345` | Phone number ID from the Meta dashboard |

Steps: Meta developers → WhatsApp product → copy token + phone number ID →
paste in *System → Connections* (encrypted, editable live) or `.env`. Verify
with *Settings → Test WhatsApp*.

## 7. Razorpay payment links

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | `rzp_live_xxxxxxxx` | Key ID |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | Key secret |

Steps: Razorpay dashboard → *Settings → API keys → Generate test/live key* →
paste into `.env` (or the Connections UI). Used for payment links on invoices
and auto-reconciliation of Razorpay payments.

## 8. Backups

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `D:\opal-backups` | Overrides the default backup folder |
| `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | passphrase | Encrypts auto-backup archives when the encrypted toggle is on |
| `BACKUP_OFFSITE_*` | see below | Push the latest backup to any S3-compatible bucket after each auto-backup |

**Off-site (S3 / R2 / B2 example):**

```env
BACKUP_OFFSITE_ENDPOINT=https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
BACKUP_OFFSITE_REGION=auto
BACKUP_OFFSITE_BUCKET=opal-backups
BACKUP_OFFSITE_KEY_ID=xxxxx
BACKUP_OFFSITE_SECRET=yyyyy
BACKUP_OFFSITE_PREFIX=opal-line
```

In-app toggles (*System → Backup & Restore*): auto-backup schedule (7:00 PM
IST), **encrypted archives**, **auto-email the archive** (≤20 MB attachment
budget), verify-all, cleanup keep-last-N. The daily summary + low-stock emails
reuse the notifications email (§4).

## 9. Silver rate pricing

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SILVER_RATE_API_URL` | `https://api.example.com/xagusd` | Metal rate source (fallback: bundled fetchers) |
| `SILVER_RATE_API_KEY` | `key` | Bearer key for the rate API |
| `LOYALTY_ENABLED` | `true` | Turns the loyalty-points module on |

Rate lifecycle: *Silver Rate page* or the scheduler updates the rate → all
product selling prices recompute → matched Shopify variants get the new price
pushed → a sync-log entry records the change.

## 10. Paths, logging, uploads (desktop/embedded use)

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `%APPDATA%\Opal Line Billing` | Desktop data root (database, env, keys) |
| `UPLOADS_DIR` | `D:\opal-uploads` | Where product images are written (default under app data) |
| `LOG_DIR` | `D:\opal-logs` | Log folder for the System Status log viewer |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` / `info` | pino level (dev default `debug`, prod `info`) |
| `APP_VERSION` | `1.0.7` | Shown on System Status |
| `DOTENV_CONFIG_PATH` | `D:\conf\opal.env` | Load `.env` from an explicit path |
| `FRONTEND_DIST` | `D:\opal\frontend-dist` | Serve the UI from an explicit folder |

## 11. Print Designer

No env vars — configured entirely in the UI (*System → Print Designer*):

1. Pick the doc tab: **Invoice / Quotation / Order / Packing slip / Pick list**.
2. Style it: header style, accent colours, fonts, page size, margins, zebra
   rows, logo, bank details, UPI QR, Packed-By/Checked-By signature lines.
3. **Save & set default** → applies to every future printout of that type.
4. **Export design** / **Import design** (`.opal-print.json`) to share designs
   or move them between machines; imports are validated server-side.

Invoices, quotations, orders, packing slips and pick lists print with product
photo thumbnails when images exist.

## 11b. Quotations: lifecycle, sending and follow-ups

A quotation moves through a real lifecycle:

```
draft ──► sent ──► approved ──► converted      (terminal)
  │        │           │
  └────────┴───────────┴──► cancelled / expired (terminal)
```

| Action | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mark as sent / approved / cancel | Quotations page, row actions | Invalid jumps are rejected server-side |
| Email quotation | Row actions (✉) | Sends the **PDF attached**; a draft flips to `sent` automatically |
| WhatsApp quotation | Row actions (💬) | Needs `customerPhone`; degrades gracefully when WhatsApp isn't configured |
| Reopen expired | Row actions (↻) | Extends validity by 15 days and returns it to `draft` |

- **Auto-expiry:** once `Valid Until` passes, the quotation becomes `expired`
  and can no longer be converted into an invoice or an order — extend it to
  revive it. Expiry runs on every list load and in a daily sweep (10:05).
- **Follow-ups** (`GET /api/v1/sales/followups`) collect what needs chasing:
  quotations sent/approved with no decision, quotes lapsing within 2 days,
  orders stuck in the pipeline, and bookings awaiting fulfilment or advance.
  Shown on the Quotations page and, scoped per customer, on Customer 360. The
  daily sweep writes a summary into the activity log.

## 11c. Purchases: line items, stock-in, supplier ledger and input GST

`Purchase → Invoices` records what actually arrived. A purchase invoice is made
of **line items** (product / SKU / qty / weight / rate / GST per line) — the
totals are derived from those lines, and each line's quantity is **added to
stock** for the matching SKU.

| Action | Effect on stock |
|---|---|
| Record purchase | `stock += qty` per line, and cost price is re-weighted |
| Edit the lines | Old lines are reversed, then the new lines are applied |
| Cancel the invoice | The stock it added is taken back out; the lines are kept |
| Reinstate a cancelled invoice | The kept lines put their stock back |
| Delete the invoice | Removed for good, with its stock reversed |

**Stock and cost.** Buying revalues the product's weighted-average cost:

```
newCost = (stockOnHand × costOnHand + boughtQty × buyPrice) / newStock
```

A product with stock but no recorded cost simply adopts the buy price. Selling
or cancelling never revalues what remains — standard weighted-average
behaviour. The result is stored in `products.cost_price`.

**Purchase returns** (`Purchase → Returns`) carry their own line items. Stock
only moves when the return is **Received** — a pending or approved return is
paperwork. Receiving takes the goods out, and undoing the receipt (or
cancelling a received return) puts them back.

Editing a line that has already been paid against is blocked if it would drop
the invoice total below what has been paid.

**Input GST split.** Each invoice stores the supplier GSTIN. The first two
digits give the supplier's state, which is compared with the business state
(taken from your own GSTIN in `System → Settings → Business`):

| Case | Charged |
|---|---|
| Same state (or no supplier GSTIN) | CGST + SGST, half each |
| Different state | IGST, in full |

With no GSTIN anywhere the purchase is treated as intra-state, which is the
same assumption the HSN summary makes for counter sales.

**TCS (194Q).** Bullion buyers owe tax collected at source. Set the rate per
invoice (usually `1`, sometimes `0.25`/`0.5`); `0` disables it. TCS is computed
on the pre-tax value and shown on the invoice.

TCS is **not** input credit — it is collected from the supplier and deposited
on their behalf, so it is a liability in its own right (GSTR-3B "TCS
collected"). `Reports → GST` shows it as its own line and it is deliberately
excluded from ITC and from net payable. Cancelled invoices drop out of it, as
they do from the input credit.

**Supplier ledger.** `Reports → Supplier Dues` shows every supplier still owed
money, split into aging buckets (0–30 / 31–60 / 60+ days). Cancelled and fully
paid invoices are excluded, so the total is always payable.

- **Pay** opens the supplier's open invoices — tick the ones this payment
  settles and enter the amount. Allocation is oldest-first and bounded by each
  invoice's balance, so repeated partial payments settle correctly and a
  supplier can never be over-paid (the API rejects it).
- **Ledger** shows the same open invoices plus the payment history and exactly
  where each payment was allocated.
- **Send Summary** emails the payables report to the notification address.
  A summary is also emailed **automatically every day at 09:20** — one email
  covering every supplier, never one per supplier, and never more than once a
  day. Set it off with `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`, or via *Settings → Notifications →
  Recipient email*. `POST /db/supplier-dues/sweep` runs it on demand.

Purchase orders carry their own line items (`purchase_order_items`) for what was
*ordered*; stock only moves when the purchase invoice is recorded. A purchase
invoice can be linked to its order (`order_id`), and
`GET /db/purchase-orders/:id/receipt` reconciles **ordered vs received** —
cancelled invoices are ignored, so a short shipment is not masked by a voided
invoice. The PO detail dialog shows the variance.

**Concurrency.** Recording a supplier payment locks the candidate invoice rows
and re-reads their balances inside a single transaction, so two payments racing
on the same invoice cannot both act on a stale balance and over-allocate it.

Schema additions are idempotent and applied on every start
(`purchase_invoice_items`, `purchase_order_items`, `supplier_payments`,
`supplier_payment_allocations`, plus the `paid_amount` / GST split / TCS columns
on `purchase_invoices`), so an existing install upgrades itself.

## 12. In-app Settings reference (*System → Settings*)

| Tab | Keys |
|---|---|
| Appearance | Theme: Light / Dark / System (also the 🌙 header toggle) |
| Business | Business name, GSTIN, phone, email, address; defaults: purity (92.5/95.8/99.9), making charge ₹/g, GST %, currency, invoice prefix, rate source (MCX), auto-update rate |
| Banking | Bank accounts used on prints |
| Compliance | E-invoicing mode (off / manual / automatic), gateway status, GSTIN reminder |
| Silver Rate | Source + auto-update. Rate changes by anyone other than an Admin / Super Admin **always** require approval (see below) |
| Notifications | Low-stock alerts, daily summary, Shopify order-import notices, payment reminders, test senders |
| Team | Role permissions overview + **Security card → "Log out other devices"** |
| Users & Roles | Per-user module/action permissions, activation, password resets |

### GST e-invoicing (IRN)

`System → Settings → Compliance` chooses how IRNs are generated:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Off** | Invoices are issued without an IRN (default) |
| **Manual** | Nothing leaves the app until someone clicks **Generate IRN** on the invoice |
| **Automatic** | Every newly issued invoice is sent to the gateway on save; cancelling stays manual |

An invoice shows its IRN, issue date and signed QR payload once generated, and
**Cancel IRN** voids it at the portal (irreversible) and marks the invoice
cancelled.

**Gateway.** No IRP round trip happens until credentials exist, so IRNs are
generated locally in the meantime — the whole flow (storage, QR, status, cancel)
works offline and is clearly marked `mock` in the QR payload. To go live, set:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CLEARTAX_GSTIN` | Your GSTIN |
| `CLEARTAX_AUTH_TOKEN` | ClearTax API auth token |
| `CLEARTAX_SANDBOX` | `true` to use the ClearTax sandbox |

Other gateways (Zoho, a direct IRP connection with your own signing
certificate) slot in as another adapter in `backend/src/einvoice.ts` — the
routes, UI and schema do not change.

### HSN summary

`Reports → HSN Summary` groups the month's **issued invoices** by the HSN code
on each product. Taxable value takes a pro-rata share of the invoice discount,
so line totals reconcile with the invoice, and GST is split into CGST/SGST or
IGST by comparing the customer's state with the business address (a blank
customer state is treated as intra-state, which is how counter sales are
charged). Products with no HSN on file land in a clearly-labelled
**Unclassified** row — worth clearing before filing.

### Silver rate approval

Rate changes made by an **Admin or Super Admin** apply immediately. A change
submitted by **any other role** (e.g. Manager) is queued as a *pending request*
and the rate stays unchanged until an Admin / Super Admin approves it —
rejecting keeps the old rate. This is enforced in the backend for every entry
point, including the legacy `/api/v1/silver/update` route, and cannot be
switched off from Settings. `POST /api/v1/silver/auto-rate/fetch-now` applies the
live MCX spot rate and reprices products, so it is likewise restricted to
Admin / Super Admin. Approvers see a pending-count badge in the header and a
"Rate Change Approvals" panel on the Silver Rate page; every submission,
approval and rejection is written to the activity log with the actor's name.

## 13. Rate limiting (operational notes)

- Login: 20 attempts / 15 min / IP; password reset: stricter; email endpoints:
  30/hour. Counters are **persisted in Postgres** (`rate_limit_hits`,
  `login_attempts`) and survive restarts.
- Behind a proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` (§2) so per-IP limits see real client IPs.
- Dev tip — clear the budget after heavy testing:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM rate_limit_hits;
  DELETE FROM login_attempts;
  ```
- E2E tests abort with a clear 429 message when the login budget is exhausted.
